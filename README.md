🕯️ Game Description 🕯️

A text-based battle game where you, the Necromancer, wield forbidden magic to face off against twisted creatures of the crypt. Choose your actions wisely—cast deadly spells or heal your cursed flesh as every decision could mean survival or demise. Will your dark powers be enough to conquer the undead... or join them?
